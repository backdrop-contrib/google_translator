# Google Translator

First, a caveat that automated translation is not perfect. Second, many browsers
now support automated translation natively, so this module may be less
necessary.

That said, this module provides an instant translated version of your site's
text via Google Website Translate. You can add the translate switch as a block.
This module provides an administration interface to allow users to activate
languages, display modes and a disclaimer text.

## Installation and usage

- Install this module using the [official Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules)
- The module can be configured at **admin/config/regional/google-translate**
- A block is provided which can be placed on a layout to provide the translation interface.
